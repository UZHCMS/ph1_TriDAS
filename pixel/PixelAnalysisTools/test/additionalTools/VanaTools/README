TO PLOT CURRENTS
===============================================================================
in main DCS panel, click View
Go to Node
choose pixel
find nodes
right click and choose nodes of type Power group
show in histogram
LV 1.25 channels
get values
click on disk
save all data
save file as e.g. /tmp/0deg_iter1.csv
finally: scp pixelshift@SCX5SCR08.cms:/tmp/0deg_iter1.csv YourIterationLogDirectory

after changing input files in currents.pl and currentsPlot.C,
> perl currents.pl
> root -l currentsPlot.C++


TO PLOT deltaVana DISTRIBUTION
=================================================================================
make input file using log and "grep deltaVana_cor" 
change input file in hist.C
> root -l hist.C



TO PLOT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IN-TIME AND ABSOLUTE THRESHOLD
=======================================================================================
make intime.dat and absolute.dat by running PixelIntimeVana.exe with special output line
cout << "(ben) ROC: " << iMap->first << " avgThr: " << avgThr << endl;
    cout << "Current Thr Unprotected= " << avgThr << endl;

then run InAbsDiff.pl then inabsdiff.C
