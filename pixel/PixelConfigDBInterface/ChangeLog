	* src/common/PixelConfigDBInterface.cc (PixelConfigDBInterface::uploadStatus): again a 
	patch to try and fix the problem of asserting if a configuration made it to the DB
	correctly or not. This time I do a double loop, one for partial and one for success.

	* src/common/PixelConfigDBInterface.cc (PixelConfigDBInterface::commitToDB): commented
	out the second (now redundant) check on upload status from the DB. This
	should make the transaction from 'in progress' to 'success' faster (approx
	10 secs gain...)

	* src/common/PixelConfigDBInterface.cc (PixelConfigDBInterface::uploadStatus): in case
	of a 'composite' upload we now test only for the final Success and not for
	the intermediate ones (marked with the 'Success[*]' label). This should
	prevent us from triggering a green light in the middle of a still ongoing
	processing.
