gmake                 makes a static library
gmake Set=fed_jam1    makes executable fed_jam1.exe in bin/... directory


prompt> bin/.../fed_jam1.exe  <ACTION> <BASEADDRESS> <FPGA GROUP> <DEVICE> <FILENAME> 

    <ACTION> may be PROGRAM or VERIFY
    <BASEADDRESS> should be hex e.g. 0x1C000000
    <FPGA GROUP> should be FRONT or CENTER
    <DEVICE> is which fiber in the VME opto card (old PCI card = 0)

for example, it will work like this with the CMS build stuff

prompt> fed_jam1.exe VERIFY 0x1C000000 CENTER 1 center.jbc

On the new machines, there may be more than one programming going at a time.
Since we determine a delay using a number of loops, the programming could
fail if the load on the machine is not balanced. In that case, we should put
a minimum in for the number of loops delay. As a test I found 620000 to be a
good minimum for a machine that is only running the one programming process
one_ms_delay = 620000L;
