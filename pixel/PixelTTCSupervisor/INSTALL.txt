~~~Installation Instructions for PixelTTCSupervisor~~~



~~Preliminaries~~

XDAQ must be installed, and all related environment variables must be
set. 

If you have not already done so, go to
$XDAQ_ROOT/pixel/PixelUtilities/PixelTestStandUtilities and enter
"make" to compile.


~~PixelTTCSupervisor and TTCSoftware~~

Before compiling PixelTTCSupervisor, you must install the CERN
software package TTCSoftware-6.05.  Go to 

http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/cms/TRIDAS/ttc/modules/software/

and download TTCSoftware-6.05.tgz to a directory of your choice.  Then
do the following:

tar -xzf TTCSoftware-6.05.tgz
cd TTCSoftware
./configure

Answer the questions according to the configuration of your system.
NOTE:  For the number of LTCs in your system, you must answer "1" or
the software will not compile.  At the end, say "yes" to updating the
XDAQ configuration files.

When the configuration process has finished, enter "make" to compile
the software. 

***Note:  PixelTTCSupervisor is guaranteed to work ONLY with version
   6.05 of TTCSoftware.  Other versions are not necessarily
   compatible.

Set the environment variable $ENV_TTCSOFTWARE_ROOT to point to the
TTCSoftware directory:

export ENV_TTCSOFTWARE_ROOT=/[...]/TTCSoftware

PixelTTCSupervisor can now be compiled:

cd $BUILD_HOME/pixel/PixelTTCSupervisor
make
